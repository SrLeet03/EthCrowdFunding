# EthCrowdFunding

CryptoFund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on blockchain technology. This platform enables people from all around the world to create campaigns and raise funds for various reasons, including health, education, social services, and creativity.



## Getting Started

To get started, simply create an account on CryptoFund and create your campaign. You will need to provide some basic information about your campaign, including the reason for your campaign, the amount of money you are trying to raise, and the deadline for your campaign.

Once your campaign is live, people can donate to your campaign using cryptocurrencies. Because this is a decentralized platform, you will have access to a greater audience, increasing your chances of success.

## Voting System

One of the unique features of CryptoFund is its voting system. When a campaign wants to retrieve the money that has been generated, it can post requests which will then be put to a vote among all the contributors.This way donors who donate to your campaign will have the ability to vote on which requests to spend money on. This ensures that the funds raised go toward the most important needs of your campaign.

## Campaigns

Campaigns on CryptoFund fall under the following categories:

- Health
- Education
- Social Service
- Creativity
- Environment
